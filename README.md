This is a simple program that I build in my C-Programming course that utilizes if-statements and do-while loops. It is a make believe program that allows for users to use a supercomputer at a cost.
It allows the user to input time in hours, minutes and seconds, while also allowing for more than one users usage input at a time.
It then calculates total numbers of users, total number of super users, which is calculated bye the total time a specfic users input and also a grand total of the charges based of all users.

Learned:
1. Do-while loops
2. if-statements
3. Do-while loops with characters
4. Accumlation of entries
