# SuperComputerCalc

This is a simple program that I built in my C-Programming course that utilizes if-else statements and do-while loops.
It is a make believe program that allows for users to use a supercomputer at a company.
It allows the user to input time in hours, minutes and seconds and based off time, it will calculate and output that time, including days and the rate at which that user will be charged for usage of the supercomputer.
Program also allows for more than one users input to be entered in at a time, will then program will output combined totals. This is a great option for a group of individuals.
Once all said and done, program will output the grand total for the number of users entered, that total combined time the supercomputer was used for, how many of those users were "Super Users", and the grand total of all charges combined.

Learned:
1. Do-while loops
2. if-else statements
3. How to repeat the input process using characters using a do-while loop
4. Accumlation of entries
